# Hi, I’m Harikrishna 👋  

Data Analyst working at the intersection of **analytics, risk, and large-scale AI systems**.

I focus on turning messy, high-volume data into **clear metrics, trustworthy dashboards, and decision-ready insights**—especially in safety-critical and user-impacting domains.

---

## 🧠 What I work on

- Designing **metrics and evaluation frameworks** for large-scale products  
- Analyzing **user behavior, engagement quality, and risk signals**  
- Building **SQL-first analytics pipelines** that scale to tens of millions of users  
- Applying **statistics and experimentation** to reduce manual effort without sacrificing quality  
- Translating analysis into **actionable recommendations** for product, policy, and ops teams

## 🏢 Experience

**Data Analyst Apprentice — Google (Hyderabad)**  
*June 2024 – Present*

- Designed and productionized a multi-class classifier evaluation framework processing 100K+ bi-weekly user feedback
signals, reducing manual review time by 4 FTE-hours per iteration and improving prioritization precision by 18% through
structured error taxonomy and threshold tuning.
• Led safety analytics for 6+ U18 GenAI product launches (e.g., NotebookLM, Gemini Web App), overseeing the pipeline from
Adversarial prompt generation - multi-stage QA - classifier performance review - Loss pattern analysis - reporting, enabling
zero P0 safety incidents at launch.
• Evaluated sensitivity–precision tradeoffs for the U18 safety classifier, recommending an optimized threshold configuration
projected to reduce U18 policy violations by 50% (1.1% → 0.6%), materially improving child-safety outcomes at scale.
• Owned behavioral log analysis across 2.9M+ AIM U18 interactions (lexical, geo-language, SOS signals), surfacing systemic
safety patterns that guided adversarial testing strategies and improved detection of self-harm and high-risk content.
• Analyzed 6.79M+ U13 Google Assistant queries to map engagement patterns and traffic distribution across feature
verticals, informing risk assessments and pre-launch safety reviews for youth-facing surfaces.

**Machine Learning Intern — Feynn Labs**  
*Jan 2024 – Mar 2024*

- Analyzed **60k+ EV records** across India using Python and SQL  
- Built predictive models and exploratory dashboards for pricing and market strategy  
- Prepared clean, structured datasets for analytics and reporting
